'''I hope your New Year is off to a great start.

This month, Delta kicked off our Centennial year at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, celebrating our first 100 years of flight while offering our vision for the future of air travel. Over the decades, technology and innovation have propelled us forward, but we’ve always been guided by our values of putting people first in everything we do.

As we embark on a new year, we’re committed to a bold vision that builds on our first century of excellence, driven by our goals of providing welcoming, elevated and caring service to you every time you fly.

Elevating The Power Of SkyMiles

The future of SkyMiles Membership is about much more than earning rewards. It’s about access to travel and lifestyle benefits you can’t find anywhere else. Partners like American Express, Starbucks, and others broaden the range of benefits we provide to you. And as we shared at CES, we have a new partner to further enhance your experience: Uber.  Beginning this spring, you’ll be able to start earning on eligible Uber rides to the airport as well as Premium and Uber Reserve rides. Plus, you’ll now earn on eligible Uber Eats deliveries, as we focus on providing value across your entire trip and beyond.

Making It All About You

For a century, the people of Delta have worked to make you and every single one of our customers feel special. Today, we’re building on that legacy to create a personalized experience for you that complements the signature, human touch that only our employees can provide.

At CES, we unveiled Delta Concierge, a digital tool built into the Fly Delta app as your own personal assistant, which uses generative AI to make your travel easier, reduce stress and inspire you to enjoy the journey. And we continue to evolve and personalize our Delta Sync platform, providing tailored entertainment and content directly to your seatback screen. We also announced that YouTube will be joining Delta, so SkyMiles Members will soon be able to enjoy their favorite creators, podcasts and music artists ad-free while on board most flights with Delta Sync Wi-Fi and on Delta Sync seatback.

Plus, coming soon, you can discover amazing destinations through the eyes of those who know them best. Delta Locals is a new, innovative platform connecting you to locally curated inspiration for your next trip.

Elevating Your Experience

We want every part of your trip to be enjoyable, whether on the ground or in the air. In the coming years, you’ll see everything from new cabin interiors designed to make you feel at home during your travels to next-generation aircraft. Delta also has ushered in a new era of premium travel for you with the opening of Delta One Lounges in New York-JFK, Boston, Los Angeles and, coming soon, Seattle. Our Lounges offer a variety of amenities for the premium traveler, from fine dining to spa-like wellness treatments and valet services. And we continue to invest in our Delta Sky Clubs, while opening new clubs, including our newest Club in Charlotte.

From its earliest days, flying has changed our world for the better, connecting people and communities in a way once unimaginable. We owe it to future generations to ensure that travel is accessible and sustainable as we bring the world closer than ever before. Together, we’re building a future of limitless possibilities.

Thank you for the trust you place in us and your continued loyalty as a valued SkyMiles Member. I’m inspired and exhilarated to have you on this journey with us.

See you in the skies.

Sincerely,'''
